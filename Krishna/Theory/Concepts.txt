1. There are typically 2 types of compilers,
    one where the scanner scans tokens and simultaneously sends
    them over to parser...and one where all tokens are generated
    first and then passed on to scanner. Ours is second type.

2.Friend CLasses
    A friend class in C++ is a class that is given special 
    access to the private and protected members of another class.
    When to Use Friend Classes?
    When two classes need a tight relationship (e.g., a SymbolTable managing a tokenClass).
    When efficiency is more important than strict encapsulation.
    When you need controlled access to private data without exposing it publicly.
example in Parser.h in class tokenClass

3. Registers: these have names that are stored in string arrays like:
string saveG[12]       = {"g8", "g9", "g18", "g19", "g20", "g21", "g22", "g23", "g24", "g25", "g26", "g27"};

This basically assigns one of these string values to a physical space in memory

Standard Registers:
    "x1" - return address, stores the name of the function we are going to jump to
    "x0" - fixed as 0, refer to this register whenever you need 0
    "fp" - frame pointer 
    "sp" - stack pointer

4. Function declaration in semantics.cpp, how it is done:


    // This is for function declaration
    // Note that every function looks like: void scanner(...)
    // so tokens inputter will be TOKEN_VOID, TOKEN_FUN
    // or TOKEN_VAR, TOKEN_FUN and so on

    // So in this part we are going to do 4 steps:
    // A.add out function to functionlist
    // B.add its arguements to arguementlist
    // C.compiler function using risc-v
    // D.push the function to scope


5. Now, how does risc-v compile functions?
        1.	Allocate space on the stack to create its initial stack frame.
        2.	Push all or any of all the saved registers on the stack. 
        3.	Push the return address on the stack, this can be omitted in the case of a leaf procedure. 
        4.	Push the frame pointer on the stack.
        5.	Make the frame pointer to point at the beginning of the stack frame e.g fp = sp + 32.


6. Note: we are making a 16 bit compiler 
Hence whenever we are allocating space for scope stack we do:
    int allocate_space = (variable * 16) + 32;
    // 32 is for the two ragisters- frame pointer fp and stack pointer sp
