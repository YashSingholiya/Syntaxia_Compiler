1. Discussing the MIPS R2000 Assembly 

It is important to keep in mind that assembly language is a low-level language, so instructions
 in assembly language are closely related to their 32-bit representation in machine language.
 Since we only have 32 bits available to encode every possible assembly instruction, MIPS
 R2000 instructions have to be simple and follow a rigid structure

    a. Arithmetic instructions:
        add a,b,c    a=b+c
        sub a,b,c    a=b-c
    Notice that each of the
    previous MIPS R2000 instructions performs 1 operation and has exactly 3 operands

    Similarly, to compute a = (b+c)-(d+e);
    add t0, b,c
    add t1,d,e
    sub a,t0,t1

    b.
